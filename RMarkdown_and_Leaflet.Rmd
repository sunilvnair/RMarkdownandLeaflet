## R Markdown and Leaflet

Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown and Leaflet 
This information will show interactive maps using library(leaflet)

```{r lib}
library(leaflet)

library(maps)
mapStates = map("Qatar", fill = TRUE, plot = FALSE)
leaflet(data = mapStates) %>% addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(fillColor = topo.colors(10, alpha = NULL), stroke = FALSE)
```

## Interactive Maps

You can use maps shon below



```{r lib-mp}
SunMap <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
SunMap <- SunMap %>% addMarkers(lat=-25.316486025, lng= 51.452419151, popup="Sunils Location")
SunMap
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
